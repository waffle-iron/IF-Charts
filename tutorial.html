Hi there pilots

This is just a simple tutorial flight on how to use the charts given you can find in IF-Charts. <br><br>

You'll need the charts for <a href="/KLAX/KLAX_dep.html">KLAX departure</a>. You'll also need <a href="https://if-charts.000webhostapp.com/KSAN/KSAN_arr.html">KSAN arrival charts</a>. We will be departing KLAX and flying to KSAN. In real life, atc tells you what departure and approach to use, but atc doesn't to that in Infinite Flight yet. So, we know we will need to depart east to get to KSAN.

The first chart we pull up is the docking chart, if it is available. We see our parking spot, and find out the active runway. In this example, the runway we will be taking off from is runway 25L. We know we want to fly east to get to KSAN, so we need a departure chart that will take us south from KLAX, then take us east along the coast. The departure chart we want to use for this is the 'HOLTZ ONE DEPARTURE'. <br><br>

You'll see that 25L is the runway at the bottom. So now we know how our departure will look like. The star like shapes you can see are the waypoints. So go to your map, and add the waypoints 'HIIPR' and 'ADORE'. These two waypoints will take you straight out of KLAX. The numbers below the waypoints are the maximum altitude that you can be at the waypoints, however remember that atc' commands take priority over charts. Anyway, we want to go east along the coast, so we need to turn. Add the point 'SHAEF' to your flight plan, which will start to turn you south. Then, add 'PEVEE'. This will take your east along the coast, which is the direction you want to go. You'll see two waypoints that then lead up to the thermal VOR, 'TRM'. <br><br>

You've now completed your departure, and you'll need to switch to your arrival charts for KSAN. It appears that 'SHAMU ONE ARRIVAL' is the correct approach plate for our arrival. This is because it shows us coming from the Norh West, which is the direction we will be coming from. The approach plate is primarily for arrivals onto 09 at KSAN, however it gives an alternate route that will bring us on right downwind in 27. Add the 'SHAMU' waypoint, which will be the next waypoint (we've already planned pass the LAX VOR and the 'EIREE' waypoint). Then, add the mission bay waypoint. This will put us on right downwind on 27 (if KSAN is using 09, you can follow the thicker black line which will drop you onto the ILS approach into 09). <br><br>

Now we have finished using our approach chart; we will need to switch to a instrument approach chart. These depend in the weather, but in this scenario, we have good visibility, so we will use the 'STREETWATER VISUAL APPROACH RWY 27'. This approach is for 27, but it's a visual, so you will need good weather (if it's bad visibility, use the 'RNAV (GPS) RWY 27' approach plate, where it will extend your downwind and align you with the ILS). Add the 'STEPN' and the 'KLOMN' waypoint, which will take you along your right downwind. Once your near higher terrain, or when you think your around 4NM away from the airport, turn into finals (remember that atc commands take priority over the charts, so if they tell you to extend downwind, do so). Once you've finished your turn, you should be aligned.

<br><br>

So now your aligned and have touched down, request taxi to parking and switch to your docking or airport chart. Here you can find where you want to taxi, and do so. <br><br>

<br><br>

Well done! You've just completed your first flight with charts. They are pretty simple to use, and you'll get better at using them the more you do. Remember, choose the departure that takes you in the direction of your departure airport, and choose the arrival chart which starts where you were coming from. Then, choose the appropriate approach chart, which starts in the correct position, and takes you to the correct runway. Make sure you only use visual approaches when the weather is good.

<br><br>
I hope this tutorial helped, and I hope you enjoy using IF-Charts!

<br><br>

Please remember that Infinite Flight does not always have he correct waypoints. The US region has accurate waypoints, but the European regions does not, so you'll have to try and use the nearest waypoint. The example flight above has all the correct waypoints.
