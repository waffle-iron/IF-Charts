# IF-Charts

A source for charts. Check on the FAQ below, or check out the wiki!

## FAQ
I am happy to announce [IF-Charts](https://if-charts.000webhostapp.com/)! IF-Charts is a site where you can search for an airport icao, and it will bring up all the charts, including SID and STAR charts, for that airport.

### What charts can I get at the moment?
At the moment, quite a few charts are up. KLAX and KSAN are included (these are popular routes), along with a few others, usch as WSSS, EGBB and more. However, charts are being added daily. You can also request charts [here](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/IF-Charts/wiki/Requesting-charts).

### Can I request for an airport to be added?
Want an airport to be added? Add an issue to the site Github; you can see how to do that [here](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/IF-Charts/wiki/Requesting-charts). If your a VA CEO, and your base airport is not there yet, please PM me to have your airport put at the top of the priority list.

### Why can't I get certain airports?
I won't be able to get charts for military airport, and smaller airports. I apologise about this, but military charts are not open to the public, and most small grass strip airports do not have charts.

### How much does it cost?
Nothing! IF-Charts is completely free to use, with no ads. I am planning to add donations that would help me get a premium domain, along with more space and uptime. However, that is not available yet.

### What devices can I use it on?
You can use IF-Charts on any device. We recommend you use it landscape, however it also works portrait. You can have IF-Charts with you whenever you have connection.

If you have any more questions, feel free to pm me or contact us via the contact page on [IF-Charts](https://if-charts.000webhostapp.com/ ).

I hope you enjoy using IF-Charts, and it will make your simulator experience much better!
